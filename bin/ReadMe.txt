This small application will assist you in downloading and installing The UnSupported AppStore for the Plex Media Server.

By running the file Win32.exe, you'll extract two files:

Plex_UnSupportedAppStore_Installer_Win.exe          <-----  THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE UNSUPPORTED APPSTORE
Plex_UnSupportedAppStore_Installer_Win.MD5.TXT      <-----  Checksum of above, only needed if you are a nerd ;-)
